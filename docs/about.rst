About Lino Così
===============

**Lino Così** is a free desktop-like web accounting application. It is targeted
to small and expanding enterprises or organisations who want more than an
off-the-shelf product.  With Lino Così you will finally perceive it as a joy
to

- manage your contacts, your catalog of products and your account
  chart
- record and print your sales invoices
- record your purchase invoices
- declare your VAT statement
- record your bank statements
- get your financial situation

Despite the fact that Lino
Così itself keeps things simple, its codebase is **used by more
sophisticated applications** like `Lino Tera
<http://tera.lino-framework.org>`__ or `Lino Voga
<http://voga.lino-framework.org>`__.

The name
========

The name *Così* was chosen because it is both an abbreviation of the
question "Comment faire une **co**\ mptabilité **si**\ mple?"[#f1]_ and
our answer to that question: "Così! c'est comme ça qu'on aime la
compta!"[#f2]_

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] French for "How to have an *easy* accounting package?" (the project
         started in Belgium where accounting is more difficult than in most
         other countries)

.. [#f2] Italian/French for "Like this! That's how we love to do accounting!"
